# excercise
As a Google User, I would like to perform a ‘Search by Image’
and visit the result specified on a configuration file
(i.e. VISIT_RESULT=“3” to visit the third result).
Use Selenium Webdriver or any alternative framework to complete this exercise.
Requisites
	- Must store an screen shot of the last visited page
	- Should validate that the search results are related to the used image
